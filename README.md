# Using Hilt in Logger Android app

Hilt is a new tool built on top of Dagger, designed with the aim of simplifying dependency injection.

Advantages of Hilt:

1. Easier Learning Curve: Hilt simplifies the dependency injection process with straightforward annotations and components, making it easier to pick up compared to Dagger.

2. Less Boilerplate: Hilt minimizes boilerplate code by automatically generating Dagger components and modules.

3. Seamless Integration with Android Components: Hilt provides predefined annotations and components specifically designed for Android, simplifying integration with common elements like Activities, Fragments, and ViewModels.

This app demonstrates the practial uses of dependency injection using Hilt with the inclusion of multiple modules under different scopes and unit testing.
